              <ul style="font-style: italic; color: white; font-size: medium; text-align:left; list-style: none;">Our Polish Borscht recipe (Barszcz) creates a beet soup that is chock full of veggies and boasts a bright, sweet and sour flavor making it a perfect first course or warming meal. Often for Polish barszcz, the soup is strained after cooking to produce a pure, red broth. This glassy broth is eaten with uszka, or mushroom-filled dumplings. It is this version of borscht that is commonly found on a traditional Polish Christmas Eve dinner tables.</ul>
              <br>
              <ul style="color: white; font-size: medium; text-align:left; list-style: none">Ingredients: 1 Tbsp salted butter
                1 onion, diced;
                4 garlic cloves, minced;
                4 medium beets, peeled and cut into 1/2 -1 inch pieces;
                2 carrots, cut into rounds;
                1 celery stalk, diced;

                1 bay leaf;
                4 c beef stock, (we prefer low sodium);
                2 Tbsp apple cider vinegar;
                1 tsp sugar;
                1/4 tsp ground black pepper;
                Pinch salt;
                Sour cream and dill, (to serve). </p>

                <li> Melt butter in a large soup pot. Add onion and garlic and cook over medium high heat, until the onion is soft (5 min).</li>

                <li> Add stock and bring to a boil. Cook until the vegetables are tender (10 min).</li>
                <li> Remove the pot from the heat. (If desired, you would strain the vegetables from your borscht now.) Stir the vinegar, sugar, pepper, and salt into the broth. Taste and adjust the salt and pepper as desired.</li>

              <p style="color: white; font-size: large; text-align: center;"><b>Żurek: Polish Sour Rye Soup</b></p>
              <ul style="font-style: italic; color: white; font-size: medium; text-align:justify; list-style: none;">With its distinctive sour flavour and hearty ingredients, this soup embodies the essence of Polish comfort food. Made with fermented rye flour and enriched with kiełbasa and aromatic spices, it’s a culinary delight worth exploring. Can’t travel to Poland right now? Make it at home — here’s how.</ul>
              <br>
              <ul style="color: white; font-size: medium; text-align:justify; list-style: none">Ingredients: 8.5 cups (2 litres, 0.5 gallon), meat stock (chicken, mixed-meat, rosół works great too),
                7 oz (200g) unsliced bacon,
                1 (200g, 7 oz) medium white onion,
                2 medium carrots (roughly 4.2 oz, 120g),
                2 parsley roots (roughly 4.2 oz, 120g) - can be substituted for a celery root,
                4 links (500g, 1.1 lb) white kiełbasa sausage (fresh, uncooked),
                2 ¼ cups (500ml) Sour Rye Flour Starter (link to a recipe in the notes),
                1 garlic clove,
                3 tbsp whipping cream (optional, 30-36% fat),
                1 tbsp dried marjoram,
                Salt to taste,
                Pepper (freshly ground) to taste. </p>
              <ul style="color: white; font-size: medium; text-align: left;">
            
              <p style="color: white; font-size: medium">Step-by-step Instruction</p>
              <ol style="color: white; font-size: medium; text-align: left;">
                <li> Get a cooking pot. Pour in the stock and start heating it up (on a medium heat).</li>
                <li>Chop bacon and onion into small cubes. Using a frying pan, fry up the bacon first. There is need to add any additional frying fat, bacon will release plenty of its own.</li>
                <li>Once the bacon fat has rendered, add the onion pieces and continue frying until both ingredients turn golden.</li>
                <li>Move the contents of the frying pan into the pot with cooking stock. If your ‘zakwas’ starter was fermented without spices (that is: bay leaves, all-spice berries and peppercorns), it’s a good moment to add them directly into the soup. I place them inside a mesh spice bag/stock sachet, so that I don't have to struggle fishing them out later.</li>
                <li>Peel carrots and parsley roots, drop them whole into the stock.</li>
                <li>Add white kiełbasa (uncut, whole links) as well and continue cooking for 30-40 minutes, until the stock becomes meaty in aroma and flavour (you’ll have to test that empirically).</li>
                <li>The next step would be to remove the spices. If you used the spice bag, just take it out. Otherwise, you can fish them out manually with a spoon, or get rid of them using a sieve - and return the soup into the pot.</li>
                <li>Now it’s time to add rye 'zakwas' starter. Add 1⅓ cup (300ml) of zakwas for a mild Żurek, up to 2 cups (or more; roughly 500ml) for a more sour result. If you’re not sure how much you should add, just pour it over gradually, tasting along the way.</li>
                <li>Add 1 tablespoon of dried marjoram and one garlic clove (crushed or roughly chopped), cook for another 4-5 minutes.Add herbs and boiled egg. Smacznego</li>
              </ol>
